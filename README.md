# AstroSage-Analytics
Astrosage has received an initial investment of â‚¹1 Crore aimed at enhancing its operations and driving significant growth. A comprehensive analysis revealed that 68% of consultations are classified as failed or incomplete, adversely impacting customer retention, while only 57% of calls come from repeat customers, indicating a need for improved engagement strategies. Additionally, 52.8% of agents received ratings below 4 out of 5, with the highest revenue generated from calls, although the majority of user interactions occur through chat. The analysis identified peak call hours between 6 AM and 4 PM. To address these challenges, it is recommended that targeted training programs be developed for agents with lower ratings, measuring their performance before and after training. Furthermore, integrating AI chatbots into the dashboard for initial free consultations can enhance user experience, while implementing load balancing technologies will optimize call distribution among agents, ensuring better management during peak hours. By focusing on these areas, Astrosage aims to improve customer satisfaction, increase retention rates, and drive revenue growth.
